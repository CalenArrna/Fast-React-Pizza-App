# Fast React Pizza

This is a practice project part of the React course I was taking. The purpose was to learn advanced React features and create a real world app.

Features of the application:

- user provides a username, no login/account creation
- user then goes to the menu to check out available pizzas, which can be placed to the cart
- quantity can also be changed on the menu and cart page
- when pizzas gathered, user navigates to the cart, then to the review their order
- then clicking on the order button, they go to the create order screen to provide name, phone number and address
- users also have an option to use geolocation to autofill their address, works with third party api
- user can make the priority of the non-prioirity orders even after sending the order
